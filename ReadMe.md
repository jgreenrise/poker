## Future Considerations

- **Enhance Error Handling:** Improve error handling by providing more specific error messages and error codes in the API responses.
- **Expand API Functionality:** Add additional endpoints to check for other poker hands, such as Flush, Full House, etc.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API calls to prevent abuse and ensure fair use of the service.
- **Deployment:** Consider containerizing the application using Docker for easier deployment and scalability.
- **Unit and Integration Tests:** Enhance the test coverage to ensure robust and reliable application behavior.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Spring Actuator) to observe the application's health and performance metrics.
